# M3 Challenge – JavaScript Debug Detective

## 🔍 Overview

In the M3 assignment, you debugged a page that crashed because of simple JavaScript errors. In this challenge, you will **create your own "broken" web page** that includes 2–3 intentional JavaScript mistakes and write a short explanation of how to fix them.

Your goal is to better understand how to **spot and explain common errors** by designing them yourself.

---

## ✅ Requirements

1. Create an HTML file with an embedded JavaScript script.
2. Include 2–3 small errors in your script (e.g., misspelled variable, missing bracket, wrong method name).
3. When the page runs, it should crash or log errors to the developer console.
4. Create a second file called `fixes.txt` or add comments in your code to explain:
   - What the error is
   - Why it causes a problem
   - How it should be fixed

---

## 💡 Suggested Mistakes

- Misspell `getElementById` (e.g., `getElementByid`)
- Leave off a closing `)` or `}`
- Use a variable before it’s declared
- Assign a number to a string variable by mistake

---

## 🧠 Learning Goal

This challenge helps you:
- Recognize error messages in the console
- Understand how small mistakes affect execution
- Explain bugs clearly—an essential skill for debugging and collaboration

---

## 🚀 Bonus (Optional)

Challenge a classmate by letting them try to fix your file—just remove your comments or `fixes.txt` first!

---

## 📂 Save your file as `m3-challenge.html` and place it in your `challenges/M3/` folder.
You may optionally include a `fixes.txt` file in the same folder.
