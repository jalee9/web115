# M4 Challenge – Dynamic Compliment Generator

## 🔍 Overview

In Module 4, you created a custom birthday greeting using functions and event handlers. For this challenge, you’ll build a **compliment generator** that uses the same techniques—but instead of a song, you’ll deliver a fun, personalized message using randomly selected compliments!

---

## ✅ Requirements

1. Create an HTML file with:
   - An input field for the user’s name
   - A button labeled “Get Compliment”
   - A paragraph with an `id="output"` for the result

2. Create the following functions:
   - `getRandomCompliment()` – randomly selects a compliment from an array of 4–5 options
   - `generateCompliment(name)` – takes a name and returns a sentence like:
     > “Alex, you are absolutely amazing!”

3. Use an **event listener** to:
   - Retrieve the user’s name from the input
   - Call the functions and display the compliment inside the `#output` paragraph
